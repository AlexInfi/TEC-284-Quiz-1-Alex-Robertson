This program utilizes the Arduino Uno to color mix an RGB LED, with three pushpins relating to each primary color. At the moment, it does not work as expected, as Green and Blue both only output a HIGH value no matter if the button is pushed or not, but the red works perfectly fine and can be color mixed with green.
